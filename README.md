# udemy-swift-angela

Hi,

This repository record the codes I wrote or I copied from somewhere else along the learning from the swift coursed taught by Angela Yu on Udemy.
Hope it will help someone else who takes the same course.
And what is more, I'd like to get any feedback from fellow coders.

Thanks for reading.
